If I don't like how the library handles just one of those components, I'm stuck with dead library weight, and sometimes it's difficult to replace a library's methods.\n\nSo what if each element of 2d games were broken up into it's own modules / repositories?\n\nWith inspiration from voxel.js, crtrdg is a collection of javascript modules used for developing 2d games.\n\nAs I learned more about node.js, the core events module, and browserify, I realized the ideal api for making simple 2d games could be based on node's events module. So you'll see a lot of crtrdg modules exposing an api that includes `.on('some event', function(){})`, which seems to make a lot of sense for games.\n\n## Other `crtrdg` modules:\n- [crtrdg-gameloop](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-gameloop)\n- [crtrdg-keyboard](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-keyboard)\n- [crtrdg-mouse](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-mouse)\n\n\n## Contributing\n- Fork this repository.\n- Create a branch for you changes.\n- Include tests if applicable.\n- Add/edit documentation for any changes.\n- Submit a pull request.\n\n## License\nMIT",
